			<h6 class="margin-b-30"><span class="color-light-black"></span><a class="color-black" href="#"></a></h6>
			<p class="margin-b-10">So my name is Priyanshu Sethi and I'm known as Abraxos across all the social platforms. I'm an India based Freelance Developer and trying to hit my stride on some various other fields too. 
				I've some experience working with multinational production houses and some renowned content creators across various platforms.
			</p>
			<p class="margin-b-10">I began Learning to code at the age of 13 and succesfully got to work on my first project for <a href="https://www.hollycal.in/"><u>Hollycal Productions</u></a> which is a full time Southern California-based Film & Photography production house with over 28 years of professional experience
			, Further the timeline I worked on many personal projects and participated in various Reverse Engineering and Web Designing Events and won accolades in both of them. 
			I started working as an Administrator for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCruU5bFrPJdrSJTut7yNiuQ"><u>Oye Velle</u></a> who has above 950,000 Subscribers on Youtube.
			</p>
			<p class="margin-b-10">I went into gaming after this and became a part of the offical Valorant Roster for HunterOfficials which was owned 
				and managed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-lz3wk_zlDpgq4iXp5Hl-g"><u>MrCyberSquad</u></a> and reached the milestone of Top 60 in Agni Series which was a nationwide event.
				</p>
				<p>Currently I'm working with  <a href=" https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8FkJPLr2CFgXpfpwaujoDw"><u>Mr.Random</u></a> as a part of his team for discord administration , Minecraft Building and Management , Moderator and some more future projects. 
					This is where I came to be known as Mr.Abraxos and I really consider to be a great oppurtunity to be an integral part of this team.
